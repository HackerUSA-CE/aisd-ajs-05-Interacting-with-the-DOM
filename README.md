## Description üìÑ

In this lab, we will focus on **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, allowing students to practice selecting and modifying elements within a web page using JavaScript. You will start with a **base HTML and CSS file** that provides structure and style. Using JavaScript, you will interact with and apply changes to elements within this base HTML, demonstrating how to dynamically manipulate the DOM and create visually engaging web pages.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Element Selection Methods**: Use `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll` to target and manipulate HTML elements.
- **Styling with JavaScript**: Apply CSS styles dynamically through JavaScript, enhancing interactivity.
- **Sequential and Timed Changes**: Use timers to stagger changes to elements, creating animated effects.

### By the end of this lab, you will:
- Learn to select and style elements on a web page dynamically.
- Manipulate element properties using various DOM selection methods.
- Apply delays and animations to create engaging, interactive page elements.

## Expected Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

Your project should be structured as follows:

```plaintext
Interacting-with-the-DOM/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
```

##

## 1. **Fork and Clone the Starter Repository**

- [ ] Begin by **forking** and then **cloning** the starter repository from GitHub to your local development environment. **Do not clone the supplied repository directly**; make sure to fork it first to have your own copy. This repository provides the base HTML and CSS files you‚Äôll use to build out the JavaScript functionality.

##

## 2. **Create a Blank `index.js` File**

- [ ] Inside your cloned project folder, create a new blank file named `index.js`. This is where you will write all your JavaScript code for interacting with the DOM.

### Note: 
The `index.js` file is already linked in the `HTML` file provided at the bottom of the `<body>` tag, so any JavaScript you write will automatically run when the HTML file is loaded:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```
##

## 3. **Open index.html in your browser**

- [ ] Open a terminal in VS Code, navigate to your project directory and use `npx serve` to start a local server and view your `index.html` file in the browser.

- [ ] Run the following command within the projects directory:

```bash
npx serve
```
